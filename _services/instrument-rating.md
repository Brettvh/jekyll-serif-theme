Become a safer and more skilled pilot by adding an instrument rating to your pilot certificate.

Our Cessna 172 has sophisticated Garmin G1000NXi glass panel avionics and a Garmin GFC700 Autopilot featuring Electronic Stability and Protection (ESP) and Under Speed Protection (USP).

You'll learn to fly in low-visibility conditions while working with air traffic control to travel to your destination!
